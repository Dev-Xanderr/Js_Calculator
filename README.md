# JavaScript Calculator

A simple, responsive calculator built with **HTML**, **CSS**, and **vanilla JavaScript**.  
This project was created to practice DOM manipulation, event handling, and basic UI layout using modern web development best practices.

## Features

- Basic arithmetic operations: addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.
- Clear and delete (backspace) functionality.
- Support for decimal numbers.
- Responsive layout that works on desktop and mobile screens.
- Keyboard and click support (if you implemented keyboard events, keep this bullet; otherwise remove it).

## Technologies Used

- **HTML5** for the calculator structure and markup. 
- **CSS3** (including Flexbox / Grid) for styling and layout.
- **JavaScript (ES6)** for calculator logic and event handling.

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/Dev-Xanderr/Js_Calculator.git
   ```
2. Navigate into the project folder:
   ```
   cd Js_Calculator
   ```
3. Open `index.html` directly in your browser (double-click or use a Live Server extension).

## Usage

- Click the buttons or use your keyboard (if supported) to enter numbers and operators. 
- Press `=` to evaluate the current expression.
- Press `C` to clear the entire input, or use the backspace button to remove the last character.

## Project Structure

- `index.html` – Main markup and calculator layout. 
- `style.css` – Styles for the calculator UI.
- `script.js` – Core JavaScript logic for handling input, updating the display, and performing calculations.

## Future Improvements

- Add more operations (percentage, square root, exponent, etc.).
- Improve keyboard accessibility and ARIA attributes. 
- Add light/dark themes and animations for a more polished UI.
